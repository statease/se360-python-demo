# Stat-Ease 360 and Python demo

This is a collection of a few Python programs that interact with Stat-Ease 360.

## Multi-response Graph

This uses the `examples\multiresponse_graph.py` script. Open Stat-Ease 360 and
load this script from the Script Window, then click File -> Run.

It will retrieve the two Analysis objects from SE360 and make predictions for
both of them while varying the A factor. These predictions are plotted on the
same Matplotlib plot.
